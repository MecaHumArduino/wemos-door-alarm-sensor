# Summary

This is a housing for a NoceMCU v3 and an HC-SR04 ultrasonic distance sensor. The lid will stay on when held upside down, but it's easy to remove. I designed this together with my son as an introduction to 3D modeling.

# Print Settings

Printer: Geeetech i3 Pro C
Rafts: No
Supports: No
Resolution: 0.2 mm
Infill: 25%

Notes: 
I printed a previous version of this in PLA. The big round holes in the wall came out quite nicely without supports, with some cooling. Since that print, I added a hole for the USB cable and some suports for the HC-SR04 sensor.

Please note that there's not enough room to plug cables onto the HC-SR04's connectors, but it will work if you bend the pins a bit. Alternatively you can just solder the wires on. It's also designed for a NodeMCU without pin header, or with the pins sticking up, whichever you prefer.
